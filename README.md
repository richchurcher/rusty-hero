Handmade Hero in Rust with SDL2 serving as the platform layer. Do I really want to write much X11 code? Well... maybe later. Platform is Arch Linux, and we'll see how portable it ends up.

Each episode is tagged as a release with a three digit number. To check out the code at a particular tag on a new branch, use:

```shell
git checkout -b episode-one 001
```


## Caveat

As far as rusting goes, I'm only just beginning to corrode.
